"""
Given a list of conversion rates as a collection of origin unit, destination unit, and  multiplier.

Design an algorithm that takes two arbitrary unit values and returns the conversion rate between them.



Equations are given in the format A / B = k, where A and B are variables represented as strings, and k is a real number (floating point number). 
Given some queries, return the answers. If the answer does not exist, return -1.0.



equations = [ ["a", "b"], ["b", "c"] ],
values = [2.0, 3.0],
queries = [ ["a", "c"], ["b", "a"], ["a", "e"], ["a", "a"], ["x", "x"] ]. 
 


The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will result in no division by zero and there is no contradiction.
